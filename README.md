# dots for dotfiles
## reinstallation
A list of installed packages was generated with
```bash
pacman -Qqen > packages.txt
```
To reinstall all packages using this list, use
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed < packages.txt
```
Similarly, AUR packages were generated by Paru with
```bash
paru -Qqem > aur_packages.txt
```
and can be regenerated with
```bash
paru -S --needed < aur_packages.txt
```
Later I will make a script that automatically does this, and I may even separate everything into pacman groups.
